![LB0003 prototype build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simtelic/lab0003-tda7240a-power-amplifier/refs/heads/main/resources/lab0003.png)

This repository contains the design files and documentation for a compact, high-efficiency TDA7240A-based power amplifier module. Designed for DIY audio enthusiasts, this module delivers up to 20W of audio output power from a 15V DC supply.

**Key Features:**

* **TDA7240A Amplifier IC:** Robust audio amplification with up to 20W output.
* **Aluminum PCB Design:** Excellent thermal conductivity for efficient heat dissipation and easy heatsink mounting.
* **Compact Footprint:** 55.5mm Ã— 35.75mm, ideal for space-constrained projects.

This repository provides:

* Schematics and PCB layout files.
* A Bill of Materials.

This is an open hardware project, and all design files are available in this repository. You can also order an assembled kit from Simtelic.
